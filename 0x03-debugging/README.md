# 0x03. C - Debugging

## Description
This repository contains the solutions for the tasks in the 0x03-debugging project. The project aims to teach the concept and process of debugging in C programming.

## Resources
Read or watch:

- [Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)
- [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What is debugging
- What are some methods of debugging manually
- How to read error messages

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

## Tasks
### 0. Multiple mains
In this task, the objective is to create a file named 0-main.c that tests the function positive_or_negative() with a case of 0. The provided main.c file is used as a reference.

### 1. Like, comment, subscribe
In this task, the objective is to comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop in the given main file.

### 2. 0 > 972?
In this task, the objective is to find the error in the given code and fix it so that it prints the correct output.

These tasks are part of the 0x03-debugging project for the ALX School Low-Level Programming curriculum.
